# tkinterDemo

This file contains a very small program that demonstrates a few key tkinter techniques:

* it makes an app window appear
* it connects to a database file, creates some dummy tables and has a test function that reads the contents of those tables.
* it has textboxes and labels in two frames, with buttons to allow switching between frames
